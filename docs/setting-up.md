## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Skypay merchant account.
- Your API key, available in your merchant dashboard.

## Merchant Dashboard

Skypay's Merchant dashboard & API differ based on the environment you're working in:

Live Environment Merchant Dashboard
**`https://app.skypay.dev`**

UAT Environment (for testing purposes) Merchant Dashboard
**`https://app-uat.skypay.dev`**

You can use merchant dashboard to generate access_key and setup the payment provider accounts like eSewa, Khalti, etc.
